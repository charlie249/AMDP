# Agile_Metrics_Dashboard_Project (AMDP)
This is where I will be completing my work based project for Deep Blue C Ltd.

You run the project by opening up the "index.html" file in your web browser which is inside the "AMDP" folder and will show the outcome of the projects code. The project provides a range of GitHub project metrics and useful information about an issue in the specified repository. 


In order to make the project target a different issue all you have to do is enter the issue number you want when prompted to when you restart or first load "index.html".
